        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="lead">HelpHaath exists to convert relentless effort into real outcomes. We teach systems — repeatable actions that produce results. Our first public product, WorkWise, is a focused 10-step system to help you get booked and paid faster.</p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p class="small">Most creators and solo founders have talent but lack a repeatable system. WorkWise gives you the system — outreach templates, time-block routines, and pre-book playbooks designed to generate early revenue.</p>

        <h2>What we promise</h2>
        <ul class="small">
          <li>Products that are actionable — you can implement today</li>
          <li>Transparent pricing and secure checkout</li>
          <li>Customer-first support — we respond and we help</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p class="small">After WorkWise: trackers, templates, Notion / Excel planner packs, and a paid community for founders who want accountability. Our technical roadmap includes a verified worker marketplace (HelpHaath) to connect services worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Founder Note</h3>
        <p class="small">This project started because I wanted a platform that supports hands-on creators who want to build a living from their work. If you pre-order, you get early access, a discount, and a place in the first cohort for our community.</p>
